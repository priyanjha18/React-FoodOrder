Project Overview: Simple Food Delivery App

This is a basic food delivery application built using React for the frontend and Express for the backend. It leverages React Context API to manage global state, particularly for implementing the cart functionality, allowing users to add, remove, and view items in real-time across the app.

The app also uses React Forms to capture and validate client information during the checkout process, making the user experience smooth and efficient.

Key Features:

Add/remove items to/from cart using React Context

Dynamic cart updates across components

Client data collection via React Forms

Backend handled with Express.js for API integration

You wanna hype it more or break it down for a portfolio or résumé? I gotchu, just say the word.
